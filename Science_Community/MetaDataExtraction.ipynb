   "source": "## Metadata Extraction with AWS Bedrock and LlamaIndex\n\nThis comprehensive technical guide demonstrates how to leverage [LlamaIndex metadata extractors](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/loading/node_parsers/modules/#metadata-extractors) with [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) LLMs to dramatically improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system performance. These extractors enhance document chunks with structured metadata that improves retrieval quality and semantic understanding, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n\n### Available Metadata Extractors\n\nLlamaIndex provides several powerful metadata extraction modules that work seamlessly with AWS Bedrock:\n\n- **`SummaryExtractor`** - Automatically generates concise summaries for document nodes/chunks, providing quick content overviews for better retrieval relevance\n- **`QuestionsAnsweredExtractor`** - Identifies and extracts potential questions that each node/chunk can answer, enabling [question-based retrieval strategies](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/understanding/querying/querying/)\n- **`TitleExtractor`** - Creates descriptive titles for document chunks based on their content context, improving document organization and navigation\n- **`EntityExtractor`** - Identifies and extracts [named entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) (people, places, organizations, concepts) from document content, enabling entity-based search and knowledge graph construction\n- **`PydanticProgramExtractor`** - Uses [structured Pydantic models](https://ojitha.github.io/python/ai/langgraph/langchain/chatgpt/2025/09/07/Python_Type_Annotation.html) to extract custom metadata schemas, providing flexible and type-safe metadata extraction\n\n### Benefits of Metadata Extraction\n\n- **Enhanced Retrieval**: Rich metadata improves semantic matching and retrieval accuracy by providing additional context clues\n- **Better Organization**: Automated titles and summaries help structure large document collections for easier navigation\n- **Query Understanding**: Question extraction enables more intuitive natural language queries and better question-answering capabilities\n- **Knowledge Discovery**: Entity extraction reveals relationships and key concepts across documents, enabling semantic search\n- **Structured Data**: Pydantic models ensure consistent, validated metadata that can be easily processed and filtered\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\nThis notebook demonstrates:\n1. **Basic Extractors**: Using built-in `QuestionsAnsweredExtractor` to generate potential questions from document chunks\n2. **Custom Pydantic Extractors**: Creating structured metadata extraction using custom schemas and AWS Bedrock LLMs\n3. **Performance Comparison**: Comparing retrieval quality between original nodes and metadata-enhanced nodes\n4. **Index Integration**: Building vector indices with enhanced metadata for improved semantic search\n\nThis approach is particularly valuable for scientific literature, research papers, and knowledge-intensive domains where precise information retrieval is critical for generating accurate, contextually relevant responses."
