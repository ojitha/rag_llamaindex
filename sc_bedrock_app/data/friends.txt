Based on my research, Einstein and Marie Curie shared many mutual acquaintances through scientific conferences, particularly the famous Solvay Conferences, and the broader European scientific community of the early 20th century. Here are the key people both scientists knew and how they were connected:
Major Mutual Acquaintances
Paul Langevin (1872-1946)

How they knew him: Paul Langevin was a French physicist who had been Pierre Curie's student before Pierre's death in 1906. Marie Curie had a romantic relationship with Langevin around 1910-1911, which became a major scandal when revealed by the French press Open CultureZME Science
Connection to Einstein: Einstein met Langevin at the 1911 Solvay Conference and developed respect for him. In Einstein's supportive letter to Curie during the scandal, he specifically mentioned Langevin as someone "with whom one feels privileged to be in contact" Read the Uplifting Letter That Albert Einstein Sent to Marie Curie During a Time of Personal Crisis (1911) | Open Culture
Professional work: Langevin developed ultrasound submarine detection during WWI and was an early advocate of Einstein's special theory of relativity

Max Planck (1858-1947)

How they knew him: Both Einstein and Curie attended the First Solvay Conference in 1911 where Planck was present. Planck had discovered energy quanta in 1900 and received the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics My Modern MetCooking Cosmos
Scientific connection: Planck was instrumental in quantum theory development, which both Einstein and Curie contributed to through their work

Henri Poincaré (1854-1912)

How they knew him: Henri Poincaré attended the 1911 Solvay Conference where he can be seen in the famous group photograph discussing problems with Marie Curie. He was known as "the last universalist" for his broad expertise across multiple scientific disciplines Linda Hall LibraryMy Modern Met
Scientific relationship: Poincaré had worked on similar ideas to Einstein regarding relativity and was one of the nominators who supported Poincaré for the Nobel Prize, including Marie Curie who nominated him Henri Poincaré - Wikipedia

Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937)

Hendrik Lorentz (1853-1928)

How they knew him: Lorentz was chairman of the first Solvay Conference on Physics in 1911, where both Einstein and Curie were present Solvay Conference - Wikipedia
Scientific significance: Lorentz had developed transformations that were crucial to Einstein's relativity theory

Niels Bohr (1885-1962)

How they knew him: Bohr attended later Solvay Conferences (particularly the famous 1927 conference) with both Einstein and Curie Solvay Conference - Wikipedia
Scientific debates: Bohr engaged in famous debates with Einstein about quantum mechanics, with Einstein saying "God does not play dice" and Bohr responding "stop telling God what to do" "The Most Intelligent Photo Ever Taken": The 1927 Solvay Council Conference, Featuring Einstein, Bohr, Curie, Heisenberg, Schrödinger & More | Open Culture

The Solvay Conferences - Primary Meeting Ground
The scientists corresponded for over twenty years (1911-1932) and met regularly at International Commission of Intellectual Cooperation meetings in Geneva, where they were photographed walking together Adam Mickiewicz UniversityAIP. The Solvay Conferences, beginning in 1911, served as the primary venue where Einstein and Curie encountered the same prominent scientists.
1911 First Solvay Conference Attendees (both Einstein and Curie present):
Seated: Walther Nernst, Marcel Brillouin, Ernest Solvay, Hendrik Lorentz, Emil Warburg, Jean Baptiste Perrin, Wilhelm Wien, Marie Skłodowska-Curie, and Henri Poincaré. Standing: Robert Goldschmidt, Max Planck, Heinrich Rubens, Arnold Sommerfeld, Frederick Lindemann, Maurice de Broglie, Martin Knudsen, Friedrich Hasenöhrl, Georges Hostelet, Edouard Herzen, James Hopwood Jeans, Ernest Rutherford, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, Albert Einstein, and Paul Langevin 29 Legendary Scientists Came Together in the "Most Intelligent Photo" Ever Taken
1927 Fifth Solvay Conference (the famous "most intelligent photo"):

Personal and Professional Relationships
Einstein and Curie developed a close personal friendship after their initial meeting. They vacationed together with their children in the summer of 1913, and Curie later defended Einstein against anti-German sentiment by lobbying for him to lecture in Paris in 1922 ZME ScienceBiography.
The scientific community of the early 20th century was relatively small and tightly knit, particularly among those working on cutting-edge physics. Their 32 letters exchanged between 1911 and 1932 show they discussed not only scientific matters but also personal thoughts and the situation of European science What did Maria Skłodowska-Curie and Albert Einstein write to each other about? | Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań, Poland, indicating they were part of a close network of intellectuals who knew each other both professionally and personally.
